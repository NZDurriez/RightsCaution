        <h2>Youths Caution</h2>
        <p><strong>Ensure all advice is provided in a language and manner the child/young person can understand.</strong></p>
        <p>Provide the following advice if there are reasonable grounds to suspect a child/young person has committed an offence, or before asking any question to obtain an admission.</p>
        <h3>In All Cases</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I am speaking to you about <em>(give reason)</em><br>OR<br>you have been arrested/detained for <em>(give reason)</em>.</li>
          <li>You may be arrested if you refuse to give your name and address.</li>
          <li>You are not obliged to accompany me; if you consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Questioning: In All Cases</h3>
        <p>After each statement, ask the young person to explain in their own words what their rights are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have the right to remain silent.</li>
          <li>You do not have to make any statement or answer any questions.</li>
          <li>If you agree to make a statement or answer questions, you can change your mind and stop at any time.</li>
          <li>Anything you say will be recorded and may be given in evidence in court.</li>
          <li>You have the right to speak with a lawyer and/or any nominated person without delay and in private before deciding whether to answer any questions.</li>
          <li>You have the right to have your lawyer or nominated person with you while you answer questions.</li>
          <li>Police have a list of lawyers you may speak to for free.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note: Any nominated person also needs to be advised of these rights.</em></p>
      </div>

      <!-- Adult Caution -->
      <div id="adult" class="caution">
        <h2>Adult Rights Caution</h2>
        <p>Provide to anyone arrested/detained or before questioning where there is sufficient evidence to charge:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are being arrested/detained for <em>(give reason)</em><br>OR<br>I am speaking to you about <em>(give reason)</em>.</li>
          <li>You have the right to remain silent.</li>
          <li>You do not have to make any statement.</li>
          <li>Anything you say will be recorded and given in evidence in court.</li>
          <li>You have the right to speak with a lawyer without delay and in private before answering any questions.</li>
          <li>Police have a list of lawyers you may speak to for free.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Do you understand your rights?</strong></p>
        <p>If the suspect says no, repeat once more. If still no answer, repeat up to 3 times—by then they clearly understand and may be exercising their right to remain silent.</p>
